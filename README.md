# What is my favorite thing about Com Sci?
I love how Computer Science covers a lot of fields. I am not someone who is really into programming or coding, but what I really like about Computer Science is the sense of accomplishment when finishing a project. Another thing that keeps me interested in Computer Science is its application on the things that I likespecifically on video games.

# What I look forward to this class?
I expect that this class would be fun. I look forward on exciting topics and on how this course subject would help me in choosing which career I would pursue in the future. Surprises are also welcome po hehe pero 'yong hindi po masyadong nakakagulat. :>
